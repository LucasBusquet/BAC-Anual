# BAC-Anual
The aim of this project was to extract data from https://cdn.buenosaires.gob.ar/datosabiertos/datasets/ministerio-de-economia-y-finanzas/buenos-aires-compras/bac_anual.csv, normalize and clean it with a script, and identify any duplicates or errors. The goal was to export the relevant columns and finally create a dashboard using Data Studio.

The project involved extracting data from a CSV file, which required normalization and cleaning to ensure the data was of good quality. This was achieved through the use of a script that handled data normalization and cleaning processes, including the identification and removal of duplicates or errors. After these processes, relevant columns were exported to facilitate the creation of a dashboard using Data Studio.
